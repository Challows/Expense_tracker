# Expense_tracker
This web app helps you track you expenses on every transaction done via your mobile wallet Mpesa. You can add transactions manually for transactions done using cash but mobile money purchases are handled automatically in the backend.

#**Credit transaction**
You can always use the "**Credit**" button after adding the amount and description of the transaction.
The total credit amount of the period you are tracking is tallied at the **Period Totals** down below the app dashboard.
The balance is also automatically updated after every credit transaction.

#**Debit transaction**
To make a debit transaction, you can use the **Debit** button to record transactions. The totals are also tallied in green below in the client dashboard.

#Refunding transactions
Sometimes it's normal to make double transactions. The app supports a refund procedure to balance out the error. The refund button is added to every transaction. To make a refund, simply click on the** Refund** button in blue from the transactions panel.

#**Resetting period**
When you want to start over again, you can reset everything to start tracking once more. This can be due to unavoidable circumstances or period end. There will be a future update for a automatic period reset depending on the customer settings.

#**Future updates**
There will be a couple of updates in the future I would like to make.
- **Introduce a settings menu for different themes**
- **Introducing a period setting for automatic resets**
- **Print function to print statements of specified periods by client**
- **Financial online assistance coach that indicates regular expenses and unnecessary expenditures powered by AI**
